        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>1/2 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>4 drops red food coloring</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons flaked coconut</li>
            <li>2 drops green food coloring</li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p>In a medium bowl, cream together the butter, confectioners' sugar and vanilla until smooth. Stir in the flour until dough is smooth. Remove 1 cup of dough, then cover and refrigerate remaining dough. Knead the red food coloring into the 1 cup of dough until the color of a hot dog is achieved. Refrigerate all dough for 1 hour.</p></li>
            <li><p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Divide the red dough into 16 portions. Roll each piece into a 2 1/2 inch long sausage shape. For buns, divide the white dough into 16 portions and shape into 3 inch logs. Slice them almost in half lengthwise. Spread the buns open and place the hot dog doughs inside, leaving buns open. Place 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheets.</p></li>
            <li><p>Bake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until firm. Remove from cookie sheets to cool. In a small jar or plastic bag, combine the coconut and green food coloring. Shake until coconut is evenly colored. Sprinkle over hot dog cookies when cool and make a zig zag with the yellow frosting for mustard.</p></li>
        </ol>
